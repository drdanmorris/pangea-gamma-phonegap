##Getting Started

####Install Node.JS
Node.JS is a platform built on Chrome's JS runtime for building fast, scalable network applications.  **Phonegap** is built on Node.JS, as is the **Grunt** Task Runner.  We also have a web server and back-end 'View Broker' which are built on Node.JS.

To install node visit http://nodejs.org/ and hit the Install button.

Once installed you will be able to execute Node.JS programs from the command-line.  You can also download Node Packages using the Node Package Manager (npm).


####Install Phonegap
Phonegap is installed using npm:

#####Windows
```
c:\npm install -g phonegap
```

#####Mac
```
c:\sudo npm install -g phonegap
```

> The -g option ensures that the package is available globally on your machine (rather than just in the current folder).  On Windows globally installed Node packages are downloaded to *c:\Users\your_user_name\appdata\Roaming\npm\node_modules*


####Install Grunt
Grunt is Task Runner which is used to create build tooling.  

#####Windows
```
c:\npm install -g grunt-cli
```

#####Mac
```
c:\sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
